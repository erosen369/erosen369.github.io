                Hello, my name is Ethan Rosenbaum. I work as a professional software engineer within a BIOS firmware development group.
                All development for this codebase is done in C and all of the work is on embedded platforms. There are some other programming 
                languages used, <abbr title="Bourne Again Shell">BaSH</abbr>, Ruby, Python, for automation and testing.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I grew up in Andover, MA. I currently live in Lowell, MA, with my cat, Barry. Hes very large, very grey, and very sweet. 
                He enjoys sitting in windows, rolling around on the floor, and sleeping.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                My primary hobby is athletics. I have completed at least one competition or competitive season in 
                basketball, marathon canoe racing, gymnastics, ultimate frisbee, and soccer. In the summers, I enjoy open water swimming and
                trail running in the summer. Currently, I am taking parkour classes at <a href="https://www.hubptc.com/">Hub Parkour Training Center</a>
                in Norton MA.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                A secondary hobby of mine is reading. I prefer non-fiction, but I do love a good story and have been known to read historical fiction.
                <i>A Gentleman in Moscow</i> by Amore Towles and <i>The Inner Game of Tennis</i> by W. Timothy Gallway are my favorite 
                fiction and non-fiction books of this recent part of my life. Presently, I am researching chronic disease, specifically as it relates to diet, 
                as well as proper human biomechanics for running and walking. This site contains a table of books which I have read recently, 
                links to the author's website, and a brief review of each text.

                            A collection of essays by biomechanist Katy Bowman. It delves into the minutia of movement
                            and extrapolates the consequences of a sedentary lifestyle on the human body and the world we
                            live in. I found the perspective of nutritious movement to be compelling. Nutritious movement
                            supports and improves ones capability to inhabit positions, walk up hills, run without pain, etc.
                            It made me re-think the natural quality of what I do in the gym and reconsider my goals for how I can
                            move.

                            Science reporter Nina Teicholz presents a compelling case for including saturated fat in a healthy diet.
                            Her well cited work presents the history of the medical establishments war on fat, takes apart the data used
                            to justify the decisions to recommend limitations on fat to americans, and exposes the weak evidence for
                            the 'healthy' diets sold to us, such as the low fat and mediterranean diets.

                            Ben Bikman's writing is insightful and digestable. This book is empowering for someone
                            who wants to have a better handle on the care they need when dealing with their condition.
